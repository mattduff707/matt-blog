## Introduction to Software Design and Architecture

**Software Architecture** - The larger scale design of a project. _Example:_ The architect of a building. The job of an software architect is to be the interface between the product and the customer and the engineering teams. If the customer expresses a requirement for the software, it is the architects job to then work with the customers to come up with the technical requirements of how the team would solve that problem. Then take those requirements to the engineering team to solve it.
<br>

**Software Design** - The smaller scale design of a project. _Example:_ The interior designer who designs each room of the building.

<br>

**Simplicity** is essential in design

<br>

**Object Oriented Modeling:** When solving a problem, object-oriented modeling involves the practice of representing key concepts through objects in your software. Depending on the problem, many concepts, even instances of people, places or things become distinct objects in the software

<br>

Always take the time to write out the requirements and design for a project

<br>

**Conceptual Design:** Works out the basic principles, the function, and the appearance.
<br>

**Technical Design:** Refines the concept design so that it works. Getting into the details of the project

<br>

**Components:** Collections of functions, classes, or other components. These pieces then represent a much simpler problem that the developers can individually implement.

<br>

**User story:** A requirement, often from the perspective of an end-user.

<br>

### Categories of Objects in Design

**Entity Objects:** Correspond to some real-world entity in the problem space. Something with a conceptually physical manifestation
<br>

**Boundary Objects:** Objects that sit at the boundary between systems. This could be an object that deals with another software system - Like an object that obtains information from the internet.
<br>

**Control Objects:** Objects which are responsible for coordination. It coordinates the activities of many different objects so that they can stay loosely coupled. Like a mediator.

<br>

**CRC Cards (Class, Responsibility, Collaborator):** Used to _Record_, _Organize_, and _Refine_ the components in your design.
