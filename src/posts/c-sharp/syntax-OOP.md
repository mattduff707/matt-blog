## Syntax

Strictly an Object Oriented language.

<br>

Hard "Typed" language. It is capable of Explicit and implicit typing.

<br>

```C#

//Explicit
string explicitString = "I'm Explicit!";


//Implicit
var implicitString = "I'm Implicit";

```

<br>

**Data types:**
_Primitives:_

- String: Text
- Char: Characters
- int: Number. Signed integer. Can be negative and positive. 32 bit datatype
- uint: Number. Unsigned integer. Can only be negative but capable of double the positive value. 32 bit datatype
- short: small number. Signed integer. can be negative and positive.
- ushort: small number. Unsigned integer. can only be positive but capable of double the positive value.
- long: Big number. signed integer. Can be negative and positive.
- ulong: Big number. Unsigned integer. can only be positive but capable of double the positive value.
- float: Decimal. Needs to be unambiguous. Example: `float pie = 3.14f` The f is required to specify it is a float and not a double.
- double: Larger decimal. Does not need to be specified.
- bool: true/false

**EVERYTHING** is an object
