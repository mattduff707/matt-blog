## Vocabulary

_Agile_ is an overarching approach and philosophy to deliver value to customers.

<br>

_Waterfall:_ The sequential or linear ordering of phases. One phase at a time. Not moving on until the current phase is complete

<br>

_Agile Methodology:_ Projects that adopt an agile project management take an iterative approach, which means the project processes are repeated often many times during the life cycle of the project. Individual iterations might get repeated depending on the feedback received. During each iteration, the team takes a subset of all the project's activities and does all the work required to complete that subset. Like many mini _waterfalls_. The purpose of this approach is to enable it to move quickly and adapt well to change.

<br>

_Agile Project Management:_ An approach to project and team management that embodies "agility" and is based on the **Agile Manifesto**.

<br>

_The Manifesto:_ Collection of **four values** and **twelve principles** that define the mindset that all Agile teams should strive for.

<br>

_Requirements:_ Conditions that must be met or tasks that must be finished to ensure the successful completion of the project.

<br>

_Deliverable:_ A tangible outcome from a project.

<br>

_Product Backlog:_ The central artifact in Scrum, where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on.

<br>

_Sprint:_ A time-boxed iteration in Scrum where work is done.

<br>

_Daily Scrum:_ A meeting of 15 or fewer minutes every day of the sprint.

## The four principles of Agile

1. _Individuals and interactions_ over processes and tools
2. _Working software_ over comprehensive documentation
3. _Customer collaboration_ of contract negotiation
4. _Responding to change_ over following a plan

<br>

Though there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the _left_ more.
<br>

Agile values and principles inform the **why**, **how**, and **what** of Agile project management planning and processes

<br>

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

This value stresses that people communicate with each other over using lots of processes and tools to force things to happen. **Example**: An email chain of several messages including clarifications and follow ups that could have been solved quicker with a brief conversation.
<br>

Agile wants to ensure that teams work together, collaborate, and help each other achieve the best outcomes they can. Agile also values individual perspectives and creativity.

<br>

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

This means that teams should prioritize spending time working on things that actually create value and avoid spending any more time than they really need on debating, writing, and reviewing documents.

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

In Agile projects, the customer's satisfaction is considered the highest priority of building a high quality and valuable product. When the manifesto discusses contracts, it refers to the official documents that require sign off and formal agreement with the customer. Agile values having the freedom to collaborate with the customers early and often. This allows teams to quickly react and adapt to what the customers need, rather than waiting out the process of negotiating contract terms just to make small changes or request resources. There will still be contracts in Agile project management, but the focus is on identifying whats really needed and leaving space for collaborative, customer-focused work.

### Responding to change over following a plan

This value stresses that every Agile team needs to acknowledge that change is inevitable. The larger or longer and more complex your project is, the more uncertainty there is. The most successful projects are the ones that are able to smoothly integrate change. Agile project managers still create and value their plans, but they can cope with and are able to adapt if the plans need revising at any time during the project.

## The Twelve principles of the Agile Manifesto

### Four themes of the Agile principles

**The Twelve principles can be broken down into 4 separate themes for better understanding**

1. **Value Delivery:** Delivering the work as quickly as possible in order to get feedback and mitigate time risk.
2. **Business Collaboration:** Collaborating with your customers helps the team get critical business information immediately, allowing them to adjust and adapt to any new information instantly.
3. **Team Dynamics and Culture:** Create an effective team culture that is inclusive, supportive, and empowering.
4. **Retrospectives and Continuous Learning:** Strive to continuously learn and adapt to what is working and what is not

<br>

### Value Delivery

_Includes 5 Principles_

<br>

1. **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.**

<br>

Whether you are working to create a product for your company or for a customer, chances are that someone is awaiting its delivery. If that delivery is delayed, the result is that the customer, user, or organization is left waiting for that added value to their lives and workflows. Agile emphasizes that delivering value to users early and often creates a steady value stream, increasing you and your customer’s success. This will build trust and confidence through continuous feedback as well as early business value realization.

<br>

2. **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.**

<br>

Delivering your product in small, frequent increments is important because it allows time and regular opportunities for stakeholders—including customers—to give feedback on its progress. This ensures that the team never spends too much time going down the wrong path.

<br>

3. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**

<br>

In Agile teams, the main way to demonstrate meaningful completion of work is to show a working piece of the solution. In software teams, that might mean a functional piece of software. In non-software teams, that might mean a critical portion of the solution that is ready to be demonstrated to users or their representatives in order to collect feedback. This is in contrast to traditional or Waterfall projects, where the completion of project documents could be used to measure progress. In Agile project management, it is not enough to say that the team is 80% done with an activity if there is no working, demonstrable artifact available to review.

<br>

4. **Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential**

<br>

The team should avoid implementing extra features into the solution that weren’t explicitly requested by the user or product owner. This includes removing procedures that are no longer necessary, and reducing unnecessary documentation.

<br>

5. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**

<br>

This principle conveys that just because the team is working fast doesn’t mean they sacrifice quality. By emphasizing quality and design throughout the project development phase, the agility, efficiency, and speed of the team will be increased. When a team delivers a well-built solution, they can quickly respond to user feedback and new information. However, if the product is low quality, implementing changes can become problematic, complex, and slow down the entire team.

<br>

### Business Collaboration

_Includes 2 principles_

<br>

6. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.**

<br>

When working in Agile, it’s important to be agile. That means being able to move swiftly, shifting direction whenever necessary. That also means that you and your team are constantly scanning your environment to make sure necessary changes are factored into the plans. Acknowledging and embracing that your plans may change (once, twice, or several times) ensures that you and your customers are maximizing your success.

<br>

7. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.**

<br>

Removing barriers between developers and people focused on the business side of the project, builds trust and understanding and ensures that the developers, or those building the solution, are in tune with the needs of the users.

<br>

### Team Dynamics and Culture

_Includes 4 principles_

<br>

8. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.**

<br>

A successful Agile team includes team members that not only trust each other to get the work done but are also trusted by their sponsors and executives to get the work done. Teams build better solutions when they are empowered and motivated to deliver difficult projects.

<br>

9.  **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face to face conversation.**

<br>

There isn’t anything quite like face-to-face communication. Face-to-face communication allows us to catch certain cues, body language, and facial expressions that are sometimes lost when using forms of communication like email, chat, or the phone. However, we can’t always be face-to-face. Establishing effective communication norms—no matter the format—is essential to effective teams.

<br>

10. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**

<br>

Maintaining a steady but careful pace will prevent errors along the way. Also, you never want your team to feel overworked or overwhelmed. On the flip side, a team that is underutilized may become bored and lose the creative spark to innovate. The Agile ideal is to achieve a steady pace of effort for the team that avoids overtime and burnout.

<br>

11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**

<br>

Team members should be able to get their work done by designing their own work processes and practices, without a manager dictating how they operate. Team members should also feel empowered to speak up with questions, concerns, or feedback.

<br>

### Retrospectives and Continuous Learning

_Includes 1 principle_

<br>

12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**

<br>

In Agile, it is important to acknowledge that learning from successes and failures is continuous. No team is perfect. There will be mistakes, challenges, trials, and triumphs. Teams should reflect on all of these different aspects of their activities so that they can make necessary adjustments.

<br>

## VUCA

VUCA is an acronym that defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world.

<br>

_Volatility:_ Rate of change and churn in a business or situation.
<br>

_Uncertainty:_ Lack of predictability or high potential for surprise.
<br>

_Complexity:_ High number of interrelated forces, issues, organizations, and factors that would influence the project.
<br>

_Ambiguity:_ Possibility of misunderstanding the conditions and root causes of events or circumstances.

## Intro to Scrum

Scrum is a framework of the Agile methodology.

### Roles

1. _Scrum Master:_ Responsible for ensuring the team lives Agile values and principles. Follows the processes and practices that the team agreed to. Focuses on helping the team do their best work.
2. _Product Owner:_ Responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development team.
3. _Development Team:_ Responsible for how a team will deliver a product.

### Reasons for Scrum's popularity

- Clear roles and responsibilities, while continuously emphasizing the power of the team as a whole.
- Regular and predictable meeting and delivery schedules, formats, and outcomes.
- Supports and reinforces the Agile values and principles, while adding structure and foundations that help new Agile teams get started and more experienced teams get better.
- Free and open for all to use. Huge amounts of online guidance and support, as well as Scrum-specific training and certifications.

### The founding principles of Scrum

- **Built-in instability:** In Scrum, teams are given the freedom to achieve important outcomes with challenging requirements. This gives teams an element of tension necessary to carry out a project of strategic importance to the company.
- **Self-organizing teams:** Scrum teams were intended to operate like their own start-up, with a unique order that lacks true hierarchy. These teams are considered self-organizing when they exhibit autonomy, continuous growth, and collaboration.
- **Overlapping development phases:** Individuals on a Scrum team must work towards synchronizing their place to meet deadlines. At some point throughout the process, each individuals pace starts to overlap with others, and eventually a collective pace is formed within the team.
- **Multi-learning:** Scrum is a framework that relies heavily on trial and error. Scrum team members also aim to stay up-to-date with changing market conditions and can respond quickly to those conditions.
- **Subtle control:** As mentioned, Scrum teams are self organizing and operate like a start-up, but that doesn't mean there is no structure at all. By creating checkpoints throughout the project to analyze team interactions and progress, scrum teams maintain control without hindering creativity.
- **Organizational transfer of learning:** Everyone is encouraged to learn skills that may be new to them as they support other team members.
