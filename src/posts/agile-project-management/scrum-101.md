## Vocabulary

## Three Pillars of Scrum

1. **Transparency:** Make the most significant aspects of our work visible to those responsible for the outcome.
2. **Inspection:** Conducting timely checks towards the outcome of a Sprint goal to detect undesirable variances.
3. **Adaption:** Continuously adjusting project, product, or processes to minimize any further deviation or issues.

## Five values of Scrum

1. **Commitment:** Personally committing to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team
2. **Courage:** The Scrum Team members must have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
3. **Focus:** Everyone focusing on the work of the Sprint and the overall goals of the Scrum Team
4. **Openness:** The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all of the work and challenges with performing the work.
5. **Respect:** Team members should respect the opinions, skills, and independence of their teammates.

## Essential Scrum Roles

- **Scrum Master:** Build the thing fast. Responsible for when the team will deliver value to its users.
- **Product Owner:** Build the right thing. Responsible for what the team builds. They also must ensure everyone understands why.
- **Development Team:** Build the thing right. Responsible for how a team will deliver the product.

Scrum teams are **cross-functional**. When a Scrum team delivers something, it's the accomplishment of the entire team. Scrum teams are self-organizing.
