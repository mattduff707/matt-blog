_Agile_ is an overarching approach and philosophy to deliver value to customers.

<br>

_Waterfall:_ The sequential or linear ordering of phases. One phase at a time. Not moving on until the current phase is complete

<br>

_Agile Methodology:_ Projects that adopt an agile project management take an iterative approach, which means the project processes are repeated often many times during the life cycle of the project. Individual iterations might get repeated depending on the feedback received. During each iteration, the team takes a subset of all the project's activities and does all the work required to complete that subset. Like many mini _waterfalls_. The purpose of this approach is to enable it to move quickly and adapt well to change.

<br>

_Agile Project Management:_ An approach to project and team management that embodies "agility" and is based on the **Agile Manifesto**.

<br>

_The Manifesto:_ Collection of **four values** and **twelve principles** that define the mindset that all Agile teams should strive for.

<br>

_Requirements:_ Conditions that must be met or tasks that must be finished to ensure the successful completion of the project.

<br>

_Deliverable:_ A tangible outcome from a project.

<br>

_Product Backlog:_ The central artifact in Scrum, where all possible ideas, deliverables, features, or tasks are captured for the team to work on.

<br>

_Sprint:_ A time-boxed iteration in Scrum where work is done.

<br>

_Daily Scrum:_ A meeting of 15 or fewer minutes every day of the sprint.

<br>

_Scrum Guide:_ Main source of truth for Scrum Teams and is available for free at Scrumguides.org

<br>

_Scrum:_ A framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.

<br>

_Iterative:_ Repeating cycles of delivery

<br>

_Incremental:_ Work is divided into smaller chunks that build on each other.

<br>

_Empiricism:_ The idea that true knowledge comes from actual, lived experience.

<br>

_Mission:_ A short statement that stays constant for your team throughout the process and gives them something to work toward.

<br>

_Product Vision:_ When you set a vision, you're making it clear what the team is responsible for and where your team's boundaries are.

<br>

_Product Backlog:_ The single authoritative source for things that a team works on to achieve the project goal

- Product features
- Product requirements
- Activities associated with product deliverables

<br>

_Sprint Backlog:_ Set of Product backlog items that are selected to be completed during the upcoming sprint

<br>

_Timebox:_ Scrum concept that refers to the estimated duration for an event

<br>

_Definition of Done:_ Agreed upon set of items that must be completed before a project or user story can be considered complete

<br>

_Product Goal:_ Describes the a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. Part of the Product Backlog

<br>

_User Stories:_ Short simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user.

<br>

_Epic:_ Collection of user stories

<br>

_Acceptance Criteria:_ The checklist you will use to decide whether the user story is done

<br>

_Backlog Refinement:_ is the act of keeping the backlog, described, estimated, and prioritized so that the scrum team can operate effectively

<br>

_Relative Estimation:_ Instead of trying to determine exactly how long a task will take, we compare the effort of that task to another task, and that becomes the estimate

<br>

_Sprint Planning:_ The entire scrum team comes together and meets to confirm how much capacity, meaning time, and people, are available during this sprint

<br>

_Sprint Review:_ A meeting with the entire Scrum Team where the product is demonstrated in order to determine which aspects are finished and which aren't.

<br>

_Product Increment:_ What is produced after a given Sprint and is considered releasable.

<br>

_Minimum Viable Product (MVP):_ Version of a product with just enough feature to satisfy early customers. Allows team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least amount of effort.

<br>

_Sprint Retrospectives:_ An essential meeting of up to 3 hours for the Scrum team to take a step back, reflect and identify improvements about how to work together as a team

<br>

_Burndown Chart:_ Measure time against the amount of work done and amount of work remaining

<br>

_Velocity:_ The measure of how many points the team burns down in a given sprint

<br>

_Work in progress limits (WIP Limits):_ Constraints on how many work items the team actively works on at any given time
