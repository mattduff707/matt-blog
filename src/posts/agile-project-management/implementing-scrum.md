## Building a Product Backlog

There are **3** key features to a product backlog.

<br>

1. Living artifact. It evolves throughout the entire lifecycle of the project.
2. Owned and adjusted by the Product Owner.
3. Prioritized list of features

<br>

## Writing User Stories

User stories are short simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user.

<br>

They are made up of three different elements: the **user**, the **action** they will take, and the **benefit** to them.
<br>

_Example:_ As a "user role", I want this "action" so that I can get this "value".

<br>

### Backlog refinement and effort estimation

Backlog refinement is the act of keeping the backlog, described, estimated, and prioritized so that the scrum team can operate effectively.
<br>

The Product owner and some or all of the Scrum Team review the backlog to ensure:

- It contains the appropriate items, and nothing new is needed or nothing needs to be removed
- That the items are prioritized by the product owner, this is also called setting the order field
- That the items at the top of the Backlog are ready for delivery with clear acceptance criteria.
- That the Backlog items include estimates or an informed assessment about how much work a particular backlog item will be

<br>

_Relative Estimation:_ Instead of trying to determine exactly how long a task will take, we compare the effort of that task to another task, and that becomes the estimate
<br>

**Example:** T-shirt sizes. Give tasks a time estimation of relative T-shirt sizes: small, medium, large, etc...

## Intro to Sprints

Within a Sprint, the amount of work is planned based on the historical capacity of the team and is made ready for the Sprint Planning event.
<br>

Sprints are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.
<br>

All the necessary work to achieve the **Product Goal**, including Sprint planning, daily scrums, sprint review, and sprint retrospective, happen within Sprints.

<br>

During the Sprint:

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
- Quality does not decrease
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned

<br>

5 Important Scrum events:

- Sprint
- Sprint planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint review
- Sprint retrospective
