##Asynchronous Javascript

###Threads

A thread is basically a single process that a program can use to complete tasks. Each thread can only do a single task at once
Task **A** --> Task **B** --> Task **C**
A task must be completed before moving to the next task

Due to computers now having multiple cores, they can now do multiple things at once
Thread 1: Task **A** --> Task **B**
Thread 2: Task **C** --> Task **D**
####Javascript is single-threaded
